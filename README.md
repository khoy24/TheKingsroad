The game functions similarly to an oregon trail type game, but themed around game of thrones. You create a
team of 4 people and try to survive the 8 day long journey. There are functions that have chances of being applied 
and killing members of the team. I used a lot of random.randint() for this. There is also a shop 
function that you can buy supplies at to help you along your journey. If at least one character makes it 
to the end, you win. I also added another file that when called prints a map of Westeros (the road they travel).
Team members can be killed instantly, or can starve. Depending on the choices you make at the beginning you will
have certain abilities that will change your gameplay experience and help you survive. 
I used dictionaries to keep track of the characters stats as they change throughout the game. The day function runs 
8 times for how many days there are, and inside of that is where all of the functions that have randomized chances 
of effecting your team are called.
